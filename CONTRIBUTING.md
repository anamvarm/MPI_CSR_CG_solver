# Contributing to Parallel CG Solver

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parallel-cg-solver.git
   cd parallel-cg-solver
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- MPI implementation (OpenMPI or MPICH)
- GCC or compatible C compiler
- GNU Make
- Git

### Building

```bash
make clean
make
```

### Testing

Run the example to ensure everything works:

```bash
make run
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### C Code Style

- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Functions: `snake_case`
  - Variables: `snake_case`
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
  - Struct types: `PascalCase`
- **Comments**: Use Doxygen-style comments for functions
- **Line Length**: Maximum 100 characters

### Example

```c
/**
 * @brief Compute the dot product of two vectors
 * 
 * @param u First vector
 * @param v Second vector
 * @param n Length of vectors
 * @return Dot product result
 */
double dot(double* u, double* v, int n) {
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum += u[i] * v[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
```

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include:

1. **Environment details**:
   - OS and version
   - MPI implementation and version
   - Compiler and version

2. **Steps to reproduce**:
   - Exact commands run
   - Input files (if possible)
   - Expected vs actual behavior

3. **Error messages**:
   - Full error output
   - Stack traces (if available)

### Example Bug Report

```markdown
**Environment:**
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- MPI: OpenMPI 4.1.1
- Compiler: GCC 11.2

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Run `make`
2. Run `mpirun -np 8 bin/cg_solver -matrix large.csr -output sol.txt`
3. Observe error

**Error:**
```
Rank 5: Failed to allocate memory
MPI_Abort called
```

**Expected:** Should run successfully with 8 processes
```
